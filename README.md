Traveling is a large growing business across all countries. Bus reservation system deals with maintenance of records of details of each passenger who had reserved a seat for a journey. It also includes maintenance of information like schedule and details of each bus.
In the past, for booking a ticket or for cancellation, one need to go out which is waste of time. 

To solve this problem, this project is raised. It maintains a record of bus information which contains bus timings and locations and also the type of bus.
By making this system online, we can reserve tickets from any part of the world. Customer can check availability of bus and reserve selective seats. 

This project provides and checks all sorts of constraints so that customer can get only useful data. The main motto of this project is to make bus reservation easy for customers.
